    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For the khandvi:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt (curd)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>

            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger-green chili paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li>For the tempering:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1-2 green chilies, slit</li>
            <li>A few curry leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)</li>
            <li>Grated coconut for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Batter:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the gram flour, yogurt, water, turmeric powder, asafoetida, salt, and ginger-green chili paste.</li>
            <li>Mix well until you have a smooth, lump-free batter.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <li>Cook the Khandvi:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan or heavy-bottomed saucepan over low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the pan and start stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens and leaves the sides of the pan. This should take about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture is thick and cooked, quickly spread it onto a clean, greased surface, such as a greased plate or a stainless steel counter-top.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <li>Roll the Khandvi:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>While the mixture is still hot, use a flat spatula to spread it evenly into a thin, even layer.</li>
            <li>Allow it to cool for a few minutes, then cut it into strips using a knife.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <li>Roll the Strips:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Gently roll each strip to form a cylindrical shape. The Khandvi should be thin and delicate, like a Swiss roll.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <li>Prepare the Tempering:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a small pan.</li>
            <li>Add mustard seeds and sesame seeds. Let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add green chilies and curry leaves. Fry for a minute.</li>
            <li>Pour this tempering over the rolled Khandvi.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and grated coconut if desired.</li>
            <li>Let the Khandvi cool for a few more minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
